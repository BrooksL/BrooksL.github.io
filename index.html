          I’m a software developer and all around
          creative problem solver from Huntsville, Alabama (Rocket City 🚀). I know this is a long shot, but here it goes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="letter__h2 centertext">
          Let me tell you why I think I’d be a great fit for this position.
        </h2>
        <p class="letter__p">
          Flexing my creative muscles and solving problems are two things I love
          doing and it seems like that’s what you’re looking for. You’re going
          to need someone who has a good eye for web design and usability, but
          doesn’t rush to overcomplicate things, I think that sounds like me.
          Someone who can handle design and front-end development roles while
          staying on track and not getting overwhelmed. Again, me.
          <div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="4986167" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.1090909090909091"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/thats-me-gif-4986167">Thats Me GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/thats-gifs">Thats GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p class="letter__p">
          I will also do these things without an ego. The last thing you need is
          someone who can’t handle rejection without feeling attacked. I am
          always open minded and know there’s probably always a better way to do
          something. You need someone who is committed to keep getting better. I
          am.
        </p>
        <p class="letter__p">
          I like to approach design projects in the same way I approach writing
          music, specifically guitar parts. I know the skills and tools I have
          available and that the possibilities are endless, but I always keep in
          mind that the part has to be completed as well as “fit” the song. I
          won’t let anything hold back my exploration into an idea or problem,
          but I also won’t get carried away and fail to deliver what’s needed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="letter__h2 centertext">
          Let me tell you why I think you (Basecamp) would be a good fit for me.
        </h2>
        <p class="letter__p">
          The general approach to work, not just any work, but the right work.
          I, like everyone else I’m sure, have been a part of a work culture
          that seemed mindless. Portions of projects were thought through but at
          some point it just turned into a free-for-all. I get the feeling that
          Basecamp isn’t like that. I want coworkers who strive to do things the
          right way, nitpick the details, and actually care about the work
          they’re doing. These things are contagious and being in an environment
          like that can only lift you up and push you to do better.
        </p>
        <p class="letter__p">
          Basecamp is the company I want to work for. You just seem to do things
          the right way, whether it’s software or people, I love your approach.
          I’ve been kicking myself for not applying to the Senior Programming
          job you were hiring for last year, so there’s no way I was gonna miss
          this chance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="letter__h2 centertext">To sum it all up...</h2>
        <p class="letter__p">
          I think we would be a great match, and I’m looking forward to the
          possibility of talking more about the position with you. Thanks for
          your time and for reading this. Keep setting the bar high and paving a
          way that's just better, I know you will!
